# ⚛️ Quantum Incident Response Simulator

***A Streamlit-powered framework to visualize and simulate quantum security incident response processes.***

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

As quantum computing evolves, it introduces new **cybersecurity threats** that traditional incident response models struggle to handle.
The **Quantum Incident Response Simulator** is designed to **demonstrate, visualize, and analyze** how incident response frameworks can adapt to quantum-based attack scenarios.

Built with **Streamlit**, the simulator provides an **interactive GUI** for generating, monitoring, and responding to simulated quantum security events in real-time — complete with visual graphs and detailed response analytics.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Quantum Incident Simulation** – Generates attack and response data dynamically
📊 **Real-Time Visualization** – Displays timelines and severity graphs interactively
🧩 **Modular Response Framework** – Follows detection → analysis → containment → recovery flow
🎨 **Streamlit GUI** – Simple and responsive dashboard interface
💾 **Report Generation** – Saves simulation data and visual output
🔐 **Educational Purpose** – Ideal for research, security learning, and demonstration
